# Happy-Honu 🐢🌊

We're so excited to share our game with you. We've been working on it for a couple months, and we hope you love it as much as we do.

We've taken heavy inspiration from Flappy Bird, but we've decided to give it a Hawaiian vibe because all of our members are from Hawaii or have ties to the island. The game is called Happy Honu, and it's a simple game where you control a turtle and try to avoid obstacles to get a high score. 

We hope you enjoy!😀
